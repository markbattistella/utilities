# How and why
When your IT department force your computer to lock after 60 seconds of inactivity - and your emails don't chime unless you're logged in - you make your own rules!

1. Download the `NoSleep.vbs` file

2. Run it

3. Profit

> You will have to run it on every boot - or put it in a task scheduler because IT departments don't seem to lock those down :shrug:
